    <!-- Hover boxes with tooltips via data-tooltip -->
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 400px; left: 1210px; width: 423px; height: 382px;"
         data-tooltip="Two withered hands, severed at the wrist, forever outstretched. Emerging from the darkness, she casts lots in silence. Palms open. What it never held. Do you seek the relic, or the absence it leaves behind?">
    </div>
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 520px; left: 1740px; width: 270px; height: 250px;"
         data-tooltip="To grip the die is to briefly feel the pull of forgotten destinies. A roll may not be your own. It holds the faintest glow — an unsettling shimmer that seems to make its edges darken and dissipate.">
    </div>

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 41px; left: 2030px; width: 610px; height: 350px;"
         data-tooltip="A flicker of warmth in a cold world. The fire may guide you, or it may consume all that you are, leaving only ashes behind.">
    </div>

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 260px; left: 2950px; width: 200px; height: 400px;"
         data-tooltip="It hums with a promise, though none have seen its source. Not a flame, nor a glow, but something in between — an unsettling illumination, or illusion, that does not flicker with the pulse of fire, nor steady with the warmth of the sun.">
    </div>
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 260px; left: 3420px; width: 200px; height: 400px;"
         data-tooltip="An unassuming sword, nevertheless unmarred and sleek. Four orbs drift about it, swirling lazily, suspended by no visible force. They do not touch the blade, yet they seem bound to it — their faint glow casts shadows on the blade, like distant stars caught in the web of a dream.">
    </div>

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 260px; left: 3890px; width: 200px; height: 400px;"
         data-tooltip="This simple vial holds a liquid of deep, unsettling blue.">
    </div>
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 41px; left: 4245px; width: 200px; height: 230px;"
         data-tooltip="A silent reminder of something lost, or something never fully realized. There is no explanation for the stain. The blood carving's meaning is lost, the symbol indecipherable.">
    </div>
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 30px; left: 4770px; width: 680px; height: 520px;"
         data-tooltip="The cold of death stirs beneath this once-glorious tapestry. The stitching is tight, intricate. At his feet, a sword lies discarded, its edge dulled not by war, but by disuse. No other remains are near. No foe, no witness. Just the posture of victory... or madness.">
    </div>
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 105px; left: 5660px; width: 170px; height: 250px;"
         data-tooltip="Its hilt is wrapped in gold wire, bent and frayed, studded with small, half-forgotten gemstones. The craftsmanship is delicate, almost reverent. More toy than blade.">
    </div>  
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 100px; left: 5980px; width: 280px; height: 180px;"
         data-tooltip="To draw near is to feel the edges of something once cherished — the echo of a place that may never have existed. One step closer, and the light recedes. One moment longer, and the yearning becomes your own.">
    </div>  

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 100px; left: 6455px; width: 180px; height: 250px;"
         data-tooltip="Porcelain blue silks fall from pale metal plates, each joint etched with soft floral patterns long faded. To be seen and never struck.">
    </div>  
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 470px; left: 5740px; width: 170px; height: 130px;"
         data-tooltip="This talisman's chain is short, close to the throat — as if meant to remind its bearer of breath, and how easily it escapes. The filigree design coils inwards endlessly, looping around absence. It is warm to the touch, yet always cold beneath it.">
    </div>  

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 390px; left: 6040px; width: 170px; height: 130px;"
         data-tooltip="A simple pendant with no effect. Even so, pleasant memories are crucial to survival on arduous journeys.">
    </div>  
    
    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 600px; left: 5980px; width: 300px; height: 180px;"
         data-tooltip="There is no noise but your own — no echo, no wind, only the soft rhythm of feet against stone. Time loses meaning here. So does distance. And yet, the tunnel offers something that the world above does not: direction.">
    </div> 

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 540px; left: 6450px; width: 200px; height: 160px;"
         data-tooltip="A simple worn chain. The metal groans softly when moved, as though still remembering the tension.">
    </div> 

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 200px; left: 7000px; width: 160px; height: 160px;"
         data-tooltip="Two skeletal hands, brittle and greying, one rests over the other in a posture of peace — or penance. No altar surrounds them. They have not moved in ages, yet the air around them hums faintly, as though some quiet will still lingers in the bones.">
    </div>

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 100px; left: 9055px; width: 180px; height: 250px;"
         data-tooltip="This mask, pale and smooth as bleached ivory, bears the painted features of a calm, unreadable face — its lips parted just enough to suggest breath, or the whisper of devotion. The world looks back with unfamiliar affection, though not always its own.">
    </div> 

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 200px; left: 9055px; width: 160px; height: 160px;"
         data-tooltip="The chatelaine jingles faintly when moved, like wind chimes in a house no longer there. Once, these keys opened doors: to chambers, to secrets, to lives now buried or burned. The wearer must ask — do they still open anything, or are they simply memories too heavy to discard?">
    </div> 

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 300px; left: 9055px; width: 160px; height: 160px;"
         data-tooltip="Worn by clerics who believed in violence done in silence. It is not clear who forged the brooch, or what it meant to bless. But those who wear it speak less — and act more quickly.">
    </div> 

    <div class="hover-box" style="top: 41px; left: 1100px; width: 300px; height: 700px;"
         data-tooltip="A single vellum sheet. A blueprint for a book of hours. Circles, enlacing, overlapping, enclosing nothing but air. To trace them is to feel the pull of meaning just out of reach — sacred design undone, or holy truth left incomplete by intent.">
